# Script
STOP< using so much space on simple functions

On the code I have a dictionary with various simple functions being called. This code can be completely simplified
to use 4 lambda functions which make the code much cleaner and conside. 


Use an anoymous function called a lambda function. TRhese functions are one line long and do not require the def keyword.
They can take in as many arguments as possible, but can only do one expression.



First use the lambda keyword and then type in the expressions. Put a semicolon, and then what you want to do with the expressions


# add = lambda x,y : x+y
# sub = lambda x,y : x-y
